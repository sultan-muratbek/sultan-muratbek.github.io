Hi there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by.

I am a third-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science (Honors Program) and Legal Studies. You can find my coursework [here](https://sultan-muratbek.github.io/markdown/).

I love teaching and mentoring—I've served on the course staff for CS 61A for five semesters now and for CS 61C for one semester as part of the CS Mentors community. My academic interests include systems design, machine learning, and multi-agent AI systems. I am currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Berkeley’s Sky Lab, where I work on multi-agent and AI systems research.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing pickleball and soccer, and I love going on long walks.

If our interests overlap or you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out!
