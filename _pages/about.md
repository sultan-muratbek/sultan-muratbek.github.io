Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by.

I am a third-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science and Legal Studies. You can find my coursework [here](https://sultan-muratbek.github.io/markdown/).

I love teaching and mentoringâ€”I've served on the course staff for CSÂ 61A for four semesters and for CSÂ 61C for one semester as part of the CS Mentors community. My academic interests include systems design and machine learning.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing pickleball and soccer, and I love going on long walks.

If our interests overlap or you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out!
